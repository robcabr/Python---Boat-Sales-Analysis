# Python---Boat-Sales-Analysis
As an analyst, I carried out analyzes regarding boat sales data. In this repository it was conducted exploratory visual analysis in python, hypothesis developments, application of advanced analytical approaches and visual presentation in a tableau storyboard.

## Objective
Build an interactive dashboard to display visually well-curated results of exploratory analysis conducted in Python. 

## Context
For this project, I selected my own data to analyze. It was conducted exploraty visual analysis in Python, to identify connections between variables, to further exploration. Also, through these connections, it was developed hypotheses, to then apply advanced analytical approaches to test them. Lastly, a storyboard in Tableau will be developed with the results of these tests. 

## Key Questions
1. Temporal Trend Analysis
- Can be noticed any increase or decrease in the number of visit depending on the country or year of the boat?
- Are there any clear trend? 
- Are there any pattern between any variable and the boat price or number of visits?
2. Spatial Analysis
- What are the most common Location(country) of a boat by number of visits?
- Is there any difference by Location? 
3. Cause and Origin Analysis
- What are the most common price of boats?
- Is it possible to notice any pattern the price during the years? Older boats tend to be less expensive than new ones?
- Is it possible to observe a correlation between any variable and the number of visits or price of the boat? 
4. Impact Analysis
- How much impact the Year_Built cause in the number of visits?
- How much impact the Price cause in the number of visits?
  
## Stakeholders
* Boat Consumers.
